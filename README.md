# NotesAppAPI
API for Notes APP
This is the README file for the NotesApp API project, which serves as the backend for a note-taking application. The API is designed to handle various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes and provides a simple and efficient way to manage and organize personal or professional notes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the NotesApp API, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (version 4 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NotesApp-API.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd NotesApp-API
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and configure the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notesapp
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

   - `PORT`: The port on which the API server will run (default: 3000).
   - `MONGODB_URI`: The URI of your MongoDB database.
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Choose a secure random string for production use.

4. Start the application:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The API server will be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The NotesApp API provides the following functionality:

- Create a new note.
- Retrieve a specific note or all notes.
- Update an existing note.
- Delete a note.

To interact with the API, you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or make HTTP requests from your application.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `GET /notes`: Get all notes.
- `GET /notes/:id`: Get a specific note by ID.
- `POST /notes`: Create a new note.
- `PUT /notes/:id`: Update a note by ID.
- `DELETE /notes/:id`: Delete a note by ID.

For detailed information on the request and response formats, please refer to the API documentation or explore the codebase.

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, include a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-token
```

To obtain a JWT, make a `POST` request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials.

## Error Handling

The API handles various types of errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. When an error occurs, the response will be in the following format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

For more details about specific error cases, refer to the API documentation.
